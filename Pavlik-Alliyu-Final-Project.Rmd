## Cleaning Data

```{r}

head(injuryMortality)

```

The above table is not tidy in the sense that the first column contains all the variables; the year variable is spread throughout each row instead of just in one column; there are tables that need to be separated for convenience; the first row has repeating information that is true for all the data and is therefore not necessary in the dataset itself.

TRAR - total rate all races
TRARM - total rate all races; male
mWhite - white males
mBnon - black non-hispanic males

```{r}

totalRateAllRaces <-
  injuryMortality[c((4:8), (10:13)), ]

TRARMale <-
  injuryMortality[16:20, ]

mWhite <-
  injuryMortality[c((22:26) , (28:31)), ]


mBnon <-
  injuryMortality[c((33:37), (39:42)), ]


mAsianPacific <-
  injuryMortality[c((44:48), (50:53)), ]


mAPnon <-
  injuryMortality[c((55:59), (61:64)), ]
