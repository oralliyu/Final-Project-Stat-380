## Cleaning Data

```{r}

head(injuryMortality)

```

The above table is not tidy in the sense that the first column contains all the variables; the year variable is spread throughout each row instead of just in one column; there are tables that need to be separated for convenience; and the first row has repeating information that is true for all the data and is therefore not necessary in the dataset itself.
